# rx-redux
A Redux implementation for Java made with [RxJava v2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)

## Installation 
```gradle
repositories {
	maven { url = "https://jitpack.io" }
}

dependencies {
	compile "com.github.martori:rx-redux:0.1.1"
}
```

## Usage
### Define a class for your state
```java
public class State{
  private int count;
  public State(int count){
  	this.count = count;
  }
  public int getCount(){
  	return count;
  }
}
```
### Define a class for your actions
```java
public enum Action{
    INC,
    DEC
}
```
### Define a reducer function or implement the RxReducer interface
```java
public State reduce(State state, Action action) {
  switch (action){
    case INC:
    	return new State(state.getCount + 1);
    case DEC:
    	return new State(state.getCount - 1);
    default:
    	return state;
  }
}
```
### Create your store
```java
RxStore<State, Action> store = new RxStore(initialState, reducer);
```
### Dispatch actions to the store
```java
store.dispatch(Action.INC);
```
### Get the current state
```java
State currentState = store.getState();
```
### Subscribe/Unsubscribe to State changes
```java
Consumer<State> callback = store.subscribe((state) -> System.out.println(state));
store.unsubscribe(callback);
```
### Work with a State Observable
```java
Observable<State> states = store.getStates();
//here you can work with your states in an Rx fashion: mapping, reducing, debouncing, etc.
//simple and absurd example: measure the length of your states when converted to strings
states.map(state -> state.toString())
	.map(s -> s.length())
    .map(l -> "the current state is "+l+" characters long")
    .subscribe(System.out::println);
```
